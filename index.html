    <h1>Why You Should Watch or Read <b style="color:red;">One Piece</b></h1>
    <p>The <em>purpose</em> of this page is to attempt to convince you to watch or read One Piece.</p>

    <p2>The reason why I decided to choose this, is because One Piece is a <em>wonderful experience</em> especially when reading the manga version of it. There's not much else out there that can compare to it in scope and size. And with that scope and size you are essentially taken on a long journey with the characters within One Piece.</p2>
</section>

    <h1>The Reasons!</h1>
    <h2>It's Still Ongoing</h2>
    <p>The reason why it is good that it is still ongoing is because that means there's an active community of fans keeping up with the show every single week. There's plenty of discussion around the show that you can interact with which is great for making friends and for theory crafting. And besides that, another good thing that comes from the show and manga being ongoing is that there are big reveals and <b>secrets</b> that even the most <b>diehard fans</b> do not know. So for instance, the One Piece, a special hidden treasure by the old Pirate King, is not known by almost anyone except for the creator Oda and his editors. What that means is that when it eventually becomes revealed you can be there to see that with everyone as it happens.</p>


    <h2>It's a Wonderful Epic Story</h2>
    <p>The characters within One Piece all have a real depth to them and their motivations, goals, and story are all very enticing. For example, the character Nami has a lot of depth to her. I'm not going to spoil too much, but the first major arc is about her and how she learns to accept help. All the other crewmembers on the crew are also given great backstories with one of my favorites being Sanji. His backstory is about being stranded on an empty island with no food. I won't spoil too much, but it was a very heartwrenching episode. If any of this convinced you, I'd heavily recommend checking out the manga versus the anime, mainly because it does not have as many pacing issues as the anime does, but the anime is still very good.</p>
